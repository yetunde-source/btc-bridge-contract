# Bitcoin-Stacks Bridge Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract facilitates secure cross-chain asset transfers between the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains, providing a robust mechanism for bridging tokens across these two networks.

## Features

- Secure cross-chain asset transfers
- Validator-based deposit confirmation
- Flexible bridge management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities

## Key Components

### Constants

- Minimum deposit: 100,000 tokens
- Maximum deposit: 1,000,000,000 tokens
- Required confirmations: 6
- Error codes for various failure scenarios

### Functions

#### Bridge Management

- `initialize-bridge()`: Start the bridge
- `pause-bridge()`: Temporarily halt bridge operations
- `resume-bridge()`: Restart paused bridge
- `add-validator()`: Add a new validator
- `remove-validator()`: Remove an existing validator

#### Transaction Functions

- `initiate-deposit()`: Start a cross-chain deposit
- `confirm-deposit()`: Validate and process a deposit
- `withdraw()`: Withdraw assets to a Bitcoin address
- `emergency-withdraw()`: Emergency asset retrieval by contract deployer

### Security Mechanisms

- Validator authentication
- Deposit amount validation
- Transaction hash verification
- Signature validation
- Address validation
- Pausing/resuming bridge functionality

## Error Handling

The contract includes detailed error codes for various scenarios:

- Authentication errors
- Invalid transaction parameters
- Insufficient balances
- Bridge status conflicts

## Usage Requirements

1. Contract must be initialized by the contract deployer
2. Validators must be added before processing deposits
3. Deposits must meet minimum and maximum amount constraints
4. Transactions require multiple validator confirmations

## Security Considerations

- Only the contract deployer can manage validators and bridge status
- Strict validation checks on all transaction parameters
- Emergency withdrawal mechanism for critical situations

## Deployment Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Minimum of one validator
- Proper initialization of bridge parameters

## Supported Operations

- Cross-chain deposits from Bitcoin to Stacks
- Withdrawals to Bitcoin addresses
- Bridge status management
- Validator management

## Limitations

- Deposits limited to specified token amount range
- Requires multiple validator confirmations
- Emergency withdrawals restricted to contract deployer
